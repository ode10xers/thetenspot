trend of the early 2000s (yikes, what were thinking?!) or you\u2019ve always had super full brows, there\u2019s a easy way to up your brow game without spending oodles of time with your makeup every morning it\u2019s brow lamination! brow lamination is also a great alternative for microblading if the idea of tiny needles in\u00a0 your eyebrows is not your jam.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">let\u2019s take a closer look at what this service entails, how it compares to microblading, and what you can\u00a0 expect from this awesome service!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what is brow lamination?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/brows-and-lashes\/\">eyebrow lamination<\/a> is anew-ish process for shaping and perfecting eyebrows; it gained popularity in o europe and then crossed over to us in canada and the\u00a0 usa as a popular solution for brow shaping. but what\u2019s the process?\u00a0 it\u2019s a perming and softening the hair follicles in with the end game of getting\u00a0 straighter, set eyebrow hairs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this means you get brows that appear fuller and tamed &#8211; brow lamination works to make your brows appear thicker and well-arranged, by getting all those unruly hairs in line . means you get picture perfect brows from morning to night!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lamination isn\u2019t designed for one style of eyebrows: if you already have thick eyebrows, a brow lamination can help them appear cleaned up and high impact, it can also help add an arch and a bit more shape to a thicker brow.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shout out to our thin- brow-crew! this service\u00a0 can help your hairs appear thicker (yeeesss!) and bring more definition to your eyebrows.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how would you compare brow lamination vs microblading?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sure, brow lamination and microblading are both\u00a0 services that can improve the appearance of brows, but they are totally different services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lamination is designed to make your existing eyebrow hairs look fuller and well-managed. improving on what you have and creating a polished, profesh look. microblading is a semi-permanent cosmetic tattooing solution (yikes!).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the biggest difference between brow lamination vs microblading? you don\u2019t have to worry about needles touching your face for a brow lam.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how long does a brow lamination last?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">looking for low maintenance? brow lamination is it! \u00a0 most laminations can last between four and six weeks, and up to eight weeks depending on how well you care for your brows. that means no eyebrow pencils, no eyebrow gel and no worries!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how often can i laminate my brows?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wondering how long to wait after brow lamination?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of course, you\u2019ll love how it looks and want to keep up this gorgeous service. you just have to wait a bit, most likely every 6 weeks. in some cases a bit longer but talk to your esthetics expert they will give you the right timeline for you and your brows.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how does brow lamination work?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">brow lamination at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae follows a two-step process. before your brow lamination begins, one of our highly trained esthetics experts will clean your eyebrows to remove lingering makeup, oils, or dirt. this ensures yours brows are
