So as long as you&#8217;re attentive when it comes to brazilian waxing aftercare and regular appointments, you&#8217;ll be able to leave it longer between appointments.<\/p>\n<h2>when should you have a brazilian wax?<\/h2>\n<p>try to plan your brazilly for about a week after your period, if you have one. if you&#8217;re worried about your skin being a little sensitive, try to avoid nicotine and caffeine and make sure you get a good night&#8217;s sleep before your appointment. this will help reduce any sensitivity and make the waxing experience go that little bit easier.<\/p>\n<p>the first time you have a brazilian wax, you can expect the appointment to take about 30 minutes. the waxing might sting a little, but the treatment will be over before you know it and you&#8217;ll have smooth, hair-free skin. your esthetics expert will explain brazilian waxing aftercare to you so that you can keep your skin looking good for as long as possible.<\/p>\n<p>one of the most important bits of post brazilian wax care is to not shave. yes, we know that&#8217;s counter-intuitive, but shaving can make you need to wax more often!<\/p>\n<p>that&#8217;s not because shaving makes your hair grow back more quickly (that&#8217;s an urban myth we have to refute quite often). rather, it&#8217;s because at any given point, your hair follicles are all at different points in terms of their growth. some are long enough to wax, some are just about poking through the skin and others have just shed their hair.<\/p>\n<p>when you wax, you remove hair that&#8217;s long. the next time you wax, you&#8217;re removing a different set of hair that&#8217;s just grown in. with regular waxing, you&#8217;ll end up having longer and longer periods between treatments and more sparse hair re-growth.<\/p>\n<h2>brazilian wax vs shaving: what&#8217;s the diff?<\/h2>\n<p>having a brazilly makes your skin look smooth and feels soft. when the hair grows back in, it&#8217;s a new hair with a fine tip so it looks thinner and you won&#8217;t have any noticeable stubble during the early phases of the regrowth.<\/p>\n<p>with shaving, you&#8217;re not actually removing the hair, but rather just cutting off the ends and leaving the thick part of the hair in place so that it can grow back in. this is why men get a &#8220;12 o-clock shadow&#8221; and why when you shave your legs or bikini area you end up feeling scratchy stubble so quickly.<\/p>\n<p>let&#8217;s not forget that waxing is gentler on your skin too. even the best razors can sometimes snag and irritate those delicate areas. ouch!<\/p>\n<p>at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae we offer more than just brazillys. we can help you with your <a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/brows-and-lashes\/\">lash and brow tint<\/a> too. we can also help you #feellikeaten at home with our <a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspotbeauty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">range of beauty products<\/a>. go on, treat yourself!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>as summer comes around it&#8217;s time to start thinking about that bikini area. getting a brazilian (aka our brazilly\u00ae) is a definite &#8220;must [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":27212,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[98,2460,426,97,371],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-27211","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-kristen-blog","category-promotions","category-test","category-tips","category-uncategorized-fr"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>how long does a brazilian wax last?
