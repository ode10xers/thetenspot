										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>when you get a manicure, youâ€™ll have to consider a few options. whether you go with a gel polish or a gel overlay, each choice comes with pros and cons. If you&#8217;re curious about the different types of manicures available, read on for a handy primer.</p>
<h2>what are shellac nails?</h2>
<p>shellac is a patented brand that&#8217;s made by one specific company. gel polish is mixed with traditional nail polish to make a nail that hardens under UV light and has a shiny finish. gel polish is popular because it&#8217;s quick and easy to use, with consistently good results.</p>
<h3>is gel polish bad for your nails?</h3>
<p>when you use UV light to cure the shellac, it adheres to the nail. because of this, it&#8217;s really important to take the time to have your extensions removed properly. if you just chip away at them, or try to yank them off because the removal process is taking too long, you could easily damage your nails.</p>
<h3>how long do gel overlayâ€™s nails last?</h3>
<p>gel overlays nails can typically last for about two weeks, although if you take good care of them the finish could last three weeks or longer. the main issue is that your nails are growing underneath the overlay, and eventually that growth will start to show. at that point, you&#8217;ll need to have the extension or overlay filled if you&#8217;ve got gel overlay or extensions. nails, take a tip from us. get them properly removed. your nails will thank you.</p>
<h2>what is gel nail polish?</h2>
<p>gel nail polish use a gel that hardens under UV light, similar to shellac. what sets gel apart is that it&#8217;s available in around three times as many colors as shellac. so if you&#8217;re particular about your look (and who isn&#8217;t?!), gel is the way to go. ourÂ <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/nails/">mani and pedi</a> service offers gel nails, because we&#8217;re big fans of their durability and versatility.</p>
<h3>acrylic vs gel overlay vs gel polish</h3>
<p>acrylic nails have lost out in popularity compared to gel overlaly and gel nail polish lately, but they do have some use cases. extensions are very strong, and they&#8217;re suited to creating ong nails. so, if you&#8217;ve been accustomed to having short nails and want to turn heads with some nice long nails, extensions could be the best option.</p>
<p>gel polish is lightweight and offers a natural-looking, shiny finish. it is hard-wearing and it does look good, so if you&#8217;re looking for smart nails for a big celebration, gel polish could get the job done.</p>
<p>gel overlay nails are strong and hard-wearing, but they&#8217;re a bit heavier than shellac. you have control over the shape of the nail, and you can fill the overlay n in and reshape it as your nails grow. gel is available in hundreds of colors, too, so you&#8217;ve got control over <em>everything. </em>at <strong>THE TEN SPOTÂ®</strong> we use a gel overlay that is vegan and cruelty-free, the BIAB<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="â„¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> aka builder in a bottle. this extra layer supports your nails and helps them grow longer, naturally.</p>
<h2>gel overlay nails vs gel polish nails â€” which is best?</h2>
<p>so&#8230; we reach the question on everyone&#8217;s lips: which is better, gel overlay or gel polish? we&#8217;re big fans of gel overlay nails, for several reasons. they&#8217;re strong enough that they feel like real nails, so you can click them together, tap them and do all those day-to-day things that would normally leave you worried about snapping a nail. yes, you heard us, you can have model-like hands and still open your own drinks!</p>
<p>not only that, gel overlay nails are low maintenance as they grow. if you decide you want to let your nails breathe for a bit, you can have them removed. alternatively, we can fix up your nails so they stay looking like new. you&#8217;re in control of your look with gel overlay nails.</p>
<p>on the other handâ€¦ gel polish is the perfect way to get a high impact long lasting manicure (or pedicure!) that has great shine and makes your natural nail look flawless.</p>
<p>if you&#8217;d like to know more about our mani and pedi treatments, <a href="https://thetenspot.com/go-long-with-the-extensions/">nail extensions</a>, and <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/brows-and-lashes/">lash and brow services</a>, just give us a call. we offer complimentary consultations, or you can just book right in for a session and pamper yourself.</p>
<p>go on. you know you want to <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>what is a bikini wax? if you like a smooth finish, a bikini wax can give you a beach look that won&#8217;t have hair poking out down there. a bikini wax is a way to remove hair from your privates and leave you with silky smooth skin. at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we help you get as much hair gone as you prefer.</p>
<p>our standard bikini wax takes off hair from the sides and top, just like a clean-up trim, leaving you with a little hair for modesty coverage when nude.</p>
<h2>how long does a bikini wax last?</h2>
<p>like all our<a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/">waxing hair removal services</a>, a bikini wax leaves you almost entirely hair-free for at least 2 weeks. in your bikini area, you&#8217;ll probably want to schedule a wax appointment every 3 weeks or so to reclaim that smooth skin, your esthetics expert will know whatâ€™s best for you, so just ask! the wax used on your privates is designed to be gentle on your skin, so you won&#8217;t have days of redness and irritation after every session.</p>
<p>in between waxing sessions, it&#8217;s a good idea to exfoliate well every couple of days to prevent ingrown hairs and keep your skin soft and supple.</p>
<h2>types of bikini wax</h2>
<p>at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we offer several kinds of bikini wax. each type takes various amounts of time and targets hair in different locations. let&#8217;s take a look at your options for hair removal.</p>
<h3>the bikini</h3>
<p><em>10 min</em>.</p>
<p>ideal for your standard bikini bottoms, the traditional bikini wax removes hair from just the sides and a little off the top. if your bikini has a traditional bottom, this wax makes sure no hair shows while you&#8217;re enjoying some fun in the sun. plus, it only takes about 10 minutes, so it&#8217;s a fairly easy way to get started.</p>
<h3>the thongkiniÂ®</h3>
<p><em>15 min.</em></p>
<p>what if you prefer a different type of bikini bottom? if thongs are your fav, aÂ thongkiniÂ® wax might be the better choice. with this style of bikini wax, we take off hair deep into the sides, along the top, and between the cheeks. it takes a bit longer than the standard bikini at 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>the bumkiniÂ®</h3>
<p><em>10 min.</em></p>
<p>if you aren&#8217;t sure what swimsuit you&#8217;ll be sporting at poolside and the beach, you might want to take off some extra, which is where the bumkiniÂ® comes in. with this wax, aka the full bush brazillyÂ®, you get a standard bikini wax (so the sides + a little off the top) plus we take care of any strays between the cheeks! You&#8217;re ready for pretty much anything.</p>
<h3>the bum-cheeky wax</h3>
<p><em>10 min.</em></p>
<p>the bum-cheeky wax is for the bum cheeks only, giving you that same smooth finish front and back.</p>
<h2>what&#8217;s the difference between a brazilian + a bikini wax?</h2>
<p>a brazilian is a type of bikini wax that takes off all the hair down there. have a few strays in the butt? say goodbye! with our signature brazilian wax service, the brazillyÂ®, you get everything off â€” including the full area and between the cheeks â€” or almost everything off; you decide. if you like to leave a little landing strip, we can do that too! the big difference between a brazilian and bikini wax is simply the amount of hair you take off.</p>
<p>we even have a service designed for the inexperienced â€” the brazillyÂ® virgin. if it&#8217;s your first time, we promise we&#8217;ll be gentle and take it slow. our service for virgins lasts 30 minutes because we guide you through the process step by step. we&#8217;ll even tell you when to take a breath, helping you minimize any pain during the process. plus, we&#8217;ll work side to side, so if you need to call it for a rain delay, you won&#8217;t be lopsided until you decide to come back to finish up.</p>
<h2>prepping for a private wax</h2>
<p>keeping your bikini area in beautiful shape requires the same dedication â€” and many of the same steps â€” as the rest of your skin care routine. here are some step-by-step directions for getting prepped for your next bikini wax:</p>
<ol>
<li>don&#8217;t shave for a while. you&#8217;ll want to let the hair grow in enough for the wax to have something to grab onto. if you shave too often, waxing isn&#8217;t very effective.</li>
<li>take an ibuprofen about an hour before your appointment. over-the-counter painkillers help with inflammation and pain, which can help reduce redness and swelling.</li>
<li>don&#8217;t schedule near your period. while THE TEN SPOTÂ® esthetics experts can take your hair off during your period t tends to be more painful. the area can be more sensitive during your period, so try not to schedule a wax for several days on either side.</li>
<li>exfoliate before, not after. you&#8217;ll need to give the privates a scrub the night before, but hold off on anything harsh for several days after. let your skin settle down first.</li>
<li>be prepared to get naked. if we can&#8217;t reach your privates, we can&#8217;t wax them. when we say get undressed, we definitely mean underwear too.</li>
</ol>
<h2>wax poetic at THE TEN SPOTÂ®</h2>
<p>there are lots of options when it comes to a bikini wax, so don&#8217;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we&#8217;re always happy to help calm your nerves and get you the endlessly soft skin you want absolutely anywhere on your body! <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/">book an appointment</a> with us today and enjoy cheerful and relaxing hair removal in style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">if keeping your brows on point has become a little time-consuming, a brow tint could be what you&#8217;re looking for. a tint can help your brows look darker and fuller, so you feel like a tenÂ® every day while saving time on your morning beauty routine. it&#8217;s a winning situation all the way around, and we love that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, if you&#8217;ve never had a professional brow tint done, you&#8217;ve got questions. what is eyebrow tinting, and how long does a brow tint last? don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ve got you covered. below, we&#8217;re diving into all your questions, so you&#8217;ll know what to expect during your first (or next) eyebrow tint service.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is eyebrow tinting?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">brow tinting is a special treatment that involves us applying a gentle dye to your brows. this dye is much gentler than hair dye, and it only has to stay on for a few minutes to achieve awesome results. and those results? darker brows that look thicker and let you embrace the &#8220;i woke up like this&#8221; vibe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can combine a brow tint with a brow lam for the most significant results. these two work together at THE TEN SPOTÂ® to create the thickest, darkest brows and results that last longer. what&#8217;s a brow lam? a simple process that keeps all your hair flowing in the right direction and keeps them that way. we always follow this up with a wax or tweeze to ensure your brows are on point.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how long does eyebrow tinting last?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">results from</span><a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/brows-and-lashes/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">brow tinting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> usually last 4 to 6 weeks when you get it done professionally. during that time, the color will gradually fade. but how quickly that happens depends on many factors, including the natural color and type of your hair. only a brow tint expert can give you a definite answer, so be sure to ask at your appointment!Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">pros + cons of eyebrow tinting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the pros of eyebrow tinting are pretty obvious. you get the appearance of thicker, darker brows without having to do them yourself every morning. plus, it&#8217;s an easy treatment that doesn&#8217;t take long, so you get big results for a minimal investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but, of course, there are always downsides or potential issues with everything. the biggest downside is that there&#8217;s a risk you could be allergic to the dye used. allergic reactions are generally localized and include pain, swelling, rash and blistering at the application site. more severe reactions are super rare but possible. if you&#8217;ve never had eyebrow tinting done and are prone to allergic reactions, ask your tech to do a small skin patch test first.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">does eyebrow tint fade after the first wash?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a professionally done eyebrow tint shouldn&#8217;t start fading after the first wash, but you&#8217;ll want to follow a few rules to ensure your results last as long as possible. for starters, you&#8217;ll want to avoid certain activities for the first 24 hours, including washing your hair, eyelids, lashes or brows. oh, and you should avoid strong sunlight and swimming, so schedule that beach day for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">next </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">all that being said, your brow tint </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> naturally fade over time. As we mentioned above, how fast depends on your natural hair color and type. but your beauty tech can give you all the deets about how often you&#8217;ll need to have it reapplied. as long as you don&#8217;t have any reactions to the tint (which are super rare), you should be perfectly fine to get a reapplication every 4 to 6 weeks or so.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">does tinting damage your eyebrows?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as long as you get your tint done at a reputable place like THE TEN SPOTÂ®, you shouldn&#8217;t see any damage to your brows. we already discussed the possibility of allergic reactions, so we know you get it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but there is one other thing to be wary of. doing your brow tint at home or going to a sketchy place could mean that harsh chemicals are used. that&#8217;s a big no-no because the skin on your face is so sensitive. good news, we know this and don&#8217;t use any of those harsh chemicals in our brow tint, brow lam or any other treatment we perform.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">microblading vs. tinting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">microblading and tinting are two options if you want your brows to look fuller and darker. but what&#8217;s the real difference?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">microblading is a process that adds pigment to your skin using a tattoo method. the results are semipermanent and will last between 6 months and 2 years, depending on various factors. this service takes about 2 hours to complete. the good news is that the results last longer because the skin is dyed instead of the hair. but this good news can also be bad news. if you don&#8217;t like the final results of your microblading, there&#8217;s nothing you can do to change it, and you&#8217;re stuck with it for up to 2 years.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and there are additional risks associated with microblading. your skin is likely to get red and puffy because it&#8217;s being tattooed. it&#8217;s also possible for the area to become infected, and the risk of allergic reaction still exists.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">tinting is a less permanent and safer way to have your brows on point. plus, on the off chance you don&#8217;t like the way your brows look, you just don&#8217;t get a reapplication when the time comes. easy peasy.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">book a brow tint from THE TEN SPOTÂ® today</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">thinking a brow tint will have you feeling like a perfect 10?</span><a href="https://go.booker.com/brand/thetenspotusbrand/locations?_gl=1*hfh0if*_gcl_au*ODIxNzYwMTMwLjE2OTA1NDA2ODU.*_ga*MTc0NDcyNzQ3LjE2OTA1NDA2ODY.*_ga_Q6Y979B0TM*MTY5MDc5ODk3NC41LjEuMTY5MDc5OTA4Ny42MC4wLjA.&_ga=2.204935760.1174732286.1690669144-174472747.1690540686"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">book your brow services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with THE TEN SPOTÂ® today!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>smooth and gorgeous. that&#8217;s what you want from a brazilian wax and that&#8217;s what you get at THE TEN SPOTÂ®. whether you&#8217;re a brazillyÂ® virgin or you know from experience what to expect, we are here for you no matter which <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/">waxing service</a> you go with.</p>
<p>we get it. we know you want to know how to prepare for a brazilian wax. and as always, if you want it, we deliver. so here&#8217;s so here&#8217;s what to do before a brazilian wax â€” plus all the faqs you want answered.</p>
<h2><strong>step 1: let it grow</strong></h2>
<p>how long should hair be for a brazilian wax? grow it a couple of weeks at least. yes, the stubble isn&#8217;t the most fun thing ever, but you need at least 1/4 inch of hair for the wax strips to grab hold of during yourÂ brazillyÂ®. that&#8217;s about the length of a grain of rice or maybe an eyelash (a real one) â€” but it&#8217;s okay if you grow it out even longer. and if it&#8217;s your very firstÂ brazilian, don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re hosting a full bush. just don&#8217;t shave ahead of time â€” our skilled estheticians will trim to the perfect length. take our word for this: do. not. shave.</p>
<h2><strong>step 2: clean it up</strong></h2>
<p>a little scrubbing, a little exfoliating â€” that can go a long way when you want a truly great brazilly. If you&#8217;ve got sweat and dead skin and ingrown hairs going on down there, they&#8217;re going to fight against the wax. we know you&#8217;re keeping everything clean and sassy already, but if you come in just post-shower, you&#8217;ll feel better (and so will your esthetician). coming on your way home from work? donâ€™t worry we have our famous wipetteÂ® available in bar for a last minute tidy up.</p>
<h2><strong>step 4: stay loose</strong></h2>
<p>you may want to show off the spectacular results of your brazilly right away by slipping into your favorite thong&#8230; but hold off on that for a sec. you are not going to wear tight jeans (or tight anything) right away after a brazilian. it&#8217;s time for those soft cotton panties and a pair of loose parachute pants or sweats. no lace (too itchy). just softness, comfort and a chance to let everything breathe for a day or so.</p>
<h2><strong>step 5: take a pain reliever</strong></h2>
<p>did you know you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever before you feel any pain? pop an ibuprofen (or another fave over-the-counter painkiller of choice) about 30 minutes before your appointment for the greatest effect. if you want to apply a numbing cream(we sell zensa (the best one) in bar!), that can help a lot, too, as it deadens the nerve cells in the skin that&#8217;s about to hit the hot wax. but don&#8217;t (do. not.) try to numb it with alcohol. it&#8217;ll make things hurt even more. you can have a mimosa or margarita after you&#8217;re done to celebrate.</p>
<h2><strong>step 6: breathe</strong></h2>
<p>deep breathing can make a real difference during your brazilly. don&#8217;t hold your breath. instead, ask your esthetics expert to guide you on some deep breathing techniques so you exhale at just the right time.</p>
<h2><strong>step 7: relax</strong></h2>
<p>yeah, easy for us to say, right? but seriously â€” the more you&#8217;re able to relax, the better your brazilian will go. maybe that means a little yoga ahead of time or some stretching exercises. after all, your esthetics expert is going to ask you to move into some unusual positions so they can reach all the nooks and crannies. maybe you&#8217;ll want to bring a stress ball to squeeze, or maybe you&#8217;re the earbud type who wants to listen to soothing music or sounds. donâ€™t forget our treatment rooms, have tvs! feel free to watch your fave show on netflix. no matter what, the more you relax, the better you&#8217;ll feel â€” and just remember that you can trust your esthetics expert , who is an expert and will be as efficient and pain-free as humanly possible.</p>
<p>now that you know how to prepare for your brazilian wax, you may have a few questions. let&#8217;s answer them</p>
<h2><strong>faqs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>can you get a brazilian wax while pregnant?</strong></h3>
<p>it&#8217;s perfectly safe to get a brazilly while you&#8217;re pregnant, though do be aware that your skin may be more sensitive at this time. hold off, though, as you approach your due date, especially if you have a c-section planned. (and if even if you don&#8217;t have one planned, as you never know what might happen.) you don&#8217;t want ultra sensitive skin during surgery, and waxing can slightly increase the risk of infection.</p>
<h3><strong>does a brazilian wax hurt?</strong></h3>
<p>for most people, yes. (hey, we will always be honest with you. always.). at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we take every step to make your brazillyÂ® as pleasant as comfortable â€” and we know you will be happy with the results. if you&#8217;re a first-timer, follow the steps above to make it all less painful, and prepare yourself mentally (including for the lack of privacy).</p>
<h3><strong>what should you not do before a brazilian wax?</strong></h3>
<p>don&#8217;t shave. don&#8217;t drink alcohol. and don&#8217;t schedule yourself too tightly (including any activities that may show off your new gorgeous smoothness), since you&#8217;ll want a little recovery time.</p>
<h3><strong>should you trim your pubic hair before a brazilian wax?</strong></h3>
<p>you can if you want, but there&#8217;s no need to. our esthetics expert will handle any trimming at the start of the procedure.</p>
<h3><strong>what are your brazilian wax options?</strong></h3>
<p>at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we offer you all sorts of cool <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/">brazilian wax options</a>. our signature brazillyÂ® takes off everything (or as much as you want), including between the cheeks â€” and we have a special customized first-timer version for your brazilian virgins. our thongkiniÂ® goes deep into the sides and top as well as between the cheeks, and our bumkiniÂ® is essentially a bikini wax with special between-the-cheek attention. of course you can get a classic bikini wax as well. call us today to book an appointment for your fave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>getting your nails done can be a relaxing experience that makes you feel fantastic. the thing is, there are so many options to choose from, with various types of extensions on offer at different salons. if you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed trying to figure out <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/nails/">the best types of nail extensions for you,</a> you&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>don&#8217;t worry, because we got you! below, we&#8217;ve created a listing of some of the most common types of nail extensions so you understand what&#8217;s available and the benefits or downsides of each type. we&#8217;ve also answered some of your most burning questionsÂ to help you figure out how to choose a type.</p>
<h2>types of nail extensions</h2>
<p>some of the most common types of nail extensions include acrylics, hard gel, acrygel, aprÃ©s, and bio gel. let&#8217;s dive into some pros and cons of these standard nail extension types.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">acrylics</span></h3>
<p>because packs of these are commonly sold in stores for you to place on atÂ home, these are likely theÂ nail extensions most people instinctively think of. while it&#8217;s true these nails are relatively easy to put on and can be extra long, they&#8217;ve got some serious downsides. for starters, acrylics have a strong smell, and they&#8217;re known to cause allergic reactions in some people &#8230; and an allergic reaction can be a real mood killer when you just want to feel fabulous. oh, acrylics also damage your natural nail because of the chemicals used.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">hard gel</h3>
<p>hard gel is a big step up from acrylics because they don&#8217;t smell awful and are more flexible, meaning less chance of breakage. you can also ustimze your length, short or long. it can be done with extensions or forms.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">acrygel</span></h3>
<p>acrygel is a hybrid extension crafted from acrylics and hard gel. it&#8217;s hypoallergenic, as well as light and flexible. but acrygel extensions can&#8217;t be soaked off and are generally hard to remove. plus, your options are minimal because not many brands make these. those that do only have a select few colors, shapes or lengths available. if you&#8217;re looking for a specific color or design, these may not be the right choice for you.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">aprÃ©s x/designEx</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 4;">with aprÃ©s x/designEx, you&#8217;ll only find premade shapes and lengths, so customizations in size and shape are a no-go. aprÃ©s extensions are easy to remove since they are soak off removal making themÂ  a healthy option for your natural nails.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">faqs</span></h2>
<p>you got questions about nail extensions? we got answers. below are answers to some of the most common questions about nail extensions to help you choose the best option.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">which type of nail extension is best?</span></h3>
<p>gel nail extensions are generally much better than acrylic nail extensions. we think our design xnail extensions are top-notch, thanks to how healthy they are for your nails. plus, they look amazing, too.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are the healthiest nail extensions?</span></h3>
<p>our revolutionary product, the extensions, is one of the healthiest types of nail extensions. designEx nail extensions are created using a special gel that can be clear or pigmented. but instead of the color being layered on top, it&#8217;s worked into the polish for a chip-free style. what&#8217;s more, at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, all our extensions are nontoxic, vegan and cruelty-free.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is better, nail extensions or acrylics?</span></h3>
<p>it depends on what you&#8217;re looking to accomplish. nail extensions are generally better because they&#8217;re healthier and more natural. but acrylics are the best choice ifÂ you&#8217;re looking for super long nails, which can&#8217;t be achieved with extensions.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are the least damaging fake nails?</span></h3>
<p>designEx nail extensions are a win again. gel nails are less likely to cause damage to your natural nail or gel bed than acrylics. they also feel more natural, so you can feel like a perfect ten without your nails feeling awkward. oh, and gel nails are more flexible, too, so if you hit them against something, they&#8217;re less likely to snap. anyone who&#8217;s had fake nails before knows the pain of one of those babies hitting something and snapping off, possibly taking part of your nail or bed (or skin) with it. yikes.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is more damaging, acrylic vs. gel nails?</span></h3>
<p>acrylic nails are definitely more damaging, hands down. acrylics can cause damage to your gorgeous natural nails, which can ultimately cause pain or even create an infection in your nail. nobody wants that when they&#8217;re just trying to live their life as a ten.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>as summer comes around it&#8217;s time to start thinking about that bikini area. getting a brazilian (aka our brazillyÂ®) is a definite &#8220;must do.&#8221; but how long does a brazilian wax last? if you haven&#8217;t had one before, you might be surprised by the answer.</p>
<p>most people can expect to have results that last for between 3 and 6 weeks. it mostly depends on how quickly your hair tends toÂ grow, as well as your skin tone compared to the color of the hair you&#8217;re having removed. even the time of year can make a difference, as many people find their hair grows more quickly during the summer.</p>
<h2>what is the best brazilian wax for your first time?</h2>
<p>let&#8217;s face it, getting your first brazilly can be a bit intimidating, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be as bad as what you sometimes see on TV. at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, we know some people are a bit nervous, which is whyÂ we even offer aÂ brazilly virgin service designed for first-timers. we&#8217;ll work a bit more slowly, tell you when to breathe and work from side to side, so if you do decide you want to stop, you&#8217;ll still have a nice neat wax job done.</p>
<p>we also offer some custom shapes. if you don&#8217;t want a <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full brazilly</a>, you can opt for a thongkini Â®that goes deep into the sides, the top and between the cheeks, or a bumkiniÂ® which is a full bush brazilly but with those pesky stray hairs between your cheeks taken care of.</p>
<p>we can wax backs, legs and chests too, so if you want to start with something a little less intimidating or just want to try waxing instead of shaving, the option&#8217;s there!</p>
<h2>how long does a brazilian wax last for the first time?</h2>
<p>after your first waxing, you can expect to see very slow and minimal hair growth during the first week or two, but it will become more noticeable during the third and fourth week. again, this varies depending on your hair type and how fast it grows, but if you&#8217;re wondering how often to get a brazilian wax, the answer is generally to expect that you&#8217;ll need to come back about 5 weeks after your first treatment.</p>
<p>with regular waxing, most people find their hair regrowth slows down over time. So as long as you&#8217;re attentive when it comes to brazilian waxing aftercare and regular appointments, you&#8217;ll be able to leave it longer between appointments.</p>
<h2>when should you have a brazilian wax?</h2>
<p>try to plan your brazilly for about a week after your period, if you have one. if you&#8217;re worried about your skin being a little sensitive, try to avoid nicotine and caffeine and make sure you get a good night&#8217;s sleep before your appointment. this will help reduce any sensitivity and make the waxing experience go that little bit easier.</p>
<p>the first time you have a brazilian wax, you can expect the appointment to take about 30 minutes. the waxing might sting a little, but the treatment will be over before you know it and you&#8217;ll have smooth, hair-free skin. your esthetics expert will explain brazilian waxing aftercare to you so that you can keep your skin looking good for as long as possible.</p>
<p>one of the most important bits of post brazilian wax care is to not shave. yes, we know that&#8217;s counter-intuitive, but shaving can make you need to wax more often!</p>
<p>that&#8217;s not because shaving makes your hair grow back more quickly (that&#8217;s an urban myth we have to refute quite often). rather, it&#8217;s because at any given point, your hair follicles are all at different points in terms of their growth. some are long enough to wax, some are just about poking through the skin and others have just shed their hair.</p>
<p>when you wax, you remove hair that&#8217;s long. the next time you wax, you&#8217;re removing a different set of hair that&#8217;s just grown in. with regular waxing, you&#8217;ll end up having longer and longer periods between treatments and more sparse hair re-growth.</p>
<h2>brazilian wax vs shaving: what&#8217;s the diff?</h2>
<p>having a brazilly makes your skin look smooth and feels soft. when the hair grows back in, it&#8217;s a new hair with a fine tip so it looks thinner and you won&#8217;t have any noticeable stubble during the early phases of the regrowth.</p>
<p>with shaving, you&#8217;re not actually removing the hair, but rather just cutting off the ends and leaving the thick part of the hair in place so that it can grow back in. this is why men get a &#8220;12 o-clock shadow&#8221; and why when you shave your legs or bikini area you end up feeling scratchy stubble so quickly.</p>
<p>let&#8217;s not forget that waxing is gentler on your skin too. even the best razors can sometimes snag and irritate those delicate areas. ouch!</p>
<p>at THE TEN SPOTÂ® we offer more than just brazillys. we can help you with your <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/brows-and-lashes/">lash and brow tint</a> too. we can also help you #feellikeaten at home with our <a href="https://thetenspotbeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">range of beauty products</a>. go on, treat yourself!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although thereâ€™s no such thing as bad body hair, everyone has preferences about where they do or donâ€™t want their hair. as an alternative to shaving, <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/services-waxing/">waxing hair removal services</a> and other treatments, the benefits of </span><a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/laser-hair-removal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laser hair removal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> make it one of the most effective ways to get rid of unwanted hair.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">laser hair removal is a short and sweet procedure that destroys hair follicles for permanent hair removal or reduction. if youâ€™re thinking about enjoying benefits such as soft and silky skin, convenient treatments and cost savings, learn more about laser hair removal and its benefits below.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how does laser hair removal work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when performed at THE TEN SPOTÂ® beauty bar, laser hair removal is aÂ surprisingly simple process. a tech applies pulses of laser to your hair and follicles, basically vaporizing it from the root and preventing it from growing back.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it typically takes several sessions to eliminate most unwanted hair, but the number of sessions youâ€™ll actually need depends largely on your hair and skin pigmentation, hair coarseness, growth cycles, hormonal influences and the area of your body. it is most effective for people with high contrast between their skin and hair, but modern lasers can address any unwanted hair. results vary, but some lucky people claim theyâ€™ve enjoyed 10 or more years of hairlessness.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">is laser hair removal healthy?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although vaporizing your hair with a laser sounds intense, itâ€™s totally safe when performed at THE TEN SPOTÂ®.Â  some redness and swelling after treatment is normal, and you should avoid and protect the lasered area from the sun. if youâ€™re pregnant, taking certain medications or have sensitive skin issues, laser hair removal may not be the right option for you talk to your ee for the best recommendation for your and your skin needs.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrolysis vs laser hair removal</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrolysis is the next most permanent hair removal option after lasering. both provide great long-term results, but electrolysis works differently by inserting an epilator into each hair follicle to stop new hair growth. since each hair needs to be individually zapped, sessions can take a long time and be pretty uncomfortable.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">9 benefits of laser hair removalÂ </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when youâ€™ve had it with the annoyances of shaving, waxing and plucking, laser hair removal is your new bestie. check out some laser hair removal benefits below.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">quick and convenient</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">lasers are fast and efficient at their job, and they can treat many hairs with just one pulse. small areas, such as the upper lip, can be done in a few minutes. if youâ€™re opting for a brazilly or bumkini session, expect to spend about 25 minutes. most areas donâ€™t take longer than 30 minutes or so, which means you can easily slot your session in without compromising on your free time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">less painful</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling laser hair removal pleasant would be a stretch, but itâ€™s definitely less painful than waxing or electrolysis. depending on the area, you might feel a pinching sensation throughout the session. it also has zero downtime â€” aside from potential slight redness, swelling or tenderness, thereâ€™s few to no side effects so you can get right back to your day post-treatment.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">precise hair removal</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">if you thought you were precise with a razor, think again. whether trimming your bikini line or regularly shaving in the shower, getting those random hairs that grow in weird places, laser hair removal can target tiny and specific areas without causing damage.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">lasers can go anywhere</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">okay, lasers can go </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anywhere. your lashes are too close to your eyes to safely laser them off, but lasers can zap hairs anywhere from up your nose to between your cheeks. that means no more shaving in sensitive areas or contorting in the shower to shave hard-to-reach hair.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">say goodbye to ingrown hairs</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">most people who have tried shaving, waxing and other hair removal methods know the pain and annoyance of ingrownÂ hairs. if youâ€™re especially prone to ingrown hairs, laser hair removal can prevent your hair from growing back. if a lasered follicle does eventually produce hair, itâ€™ll be finer and less likely to curl and become ingrown.Â </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistent soft + silky results</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlike shaving, laser hair removal wonâ€™t leave behind stray hairs or stubble and consistently has soft and silky results. even between treatments when some hairs grow back, they should be much thinner and softer than they were pre-zapping. it may even reduce acne or other skin issues caused by unruly hair follicles, improving your skinâ€™s texture over time.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">no more awkward regrowth</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">waxing and plucking require you to endure that awkward regrowth phase before hair is long enough to treat again. with laser hair removal, youâ€™ll actually need to shave before each session so the laserâ€™s energy can focus on the hair root.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">save money!</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although the upfront cost of laser hair removal can be off putting, itâ€™s actually much easier on your wallet than other hair removal options. between shaving creams, razors and waxing appointments, hair removal costs can add up over time. when you zap these costs with laser hair removal, youâ€™ll see savings in the long term.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">long term + permanent</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the main benefits of laser hair removal is its long-term potency and permanence. in most cases, hair is unlikely to grow back after the follicle is destroyed. at the minimum, youâ€™ll see a permanent reduction in hair growth and increased fineness that makes maintenance easier. you may need a touch up occasionally, but results should last for years after treatment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&#8217;ve been curling your lashes for years now, ever since you figured out how great it looks. it&#8217;s gotten to be a regular part of your beauty routine, but what if you could get that look for weeks at a time with no touch-ups? you totally can! the magic word is lash lift. what are lash lifts, you ask? check it out:</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">what are lash lifts?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">lash lifts are a professional eyelash lifting procedure that leaves your lashes looking full and lifted for weeks without having to do anything to them at home. when you get a lash lift, you&#8217;re changing the shape and augmenting your natural lashes to curl up and look thicker and fuller.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how does it work?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it takes about 40 minutes to do most people&#8217;s lashes. we start by cleaning your lashes with a gentle solution to cleanse prepare their surfaces all over. then we lay a protective silicone shield over your eyelid to keep the adhesive off your skin as well as secure your lower lashes down and away from the upper lashes we will be working with. adhesive is applied to the shield, we curl the lashes evenly up over the shield to get the shape they need. finally,Â  we apply las solution for 8 minutes, followed by a neutralizing solution for 5 minutes. you&#8217;re all good right after the job is done!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to take care of your new lashes</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">after your new lashes are finished, it&#8217;s a good idea to keep makeup and water off of them for about 24 hours. that lets the product we use to fix the lashes fully set (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">water touching the hair will open the hair cuticles and alter the bonds)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. after that, you&#8217;re good to go. just do your normal makeup routine, treat your new, full-bodied lashes like you would any other amazingly beautiful part of your face. all thatâ€™s left to do is enjoy compliments from friends who can&#8217;t quite place what&#8217;s changed about your look, but who like whatever it is you&#8217;re doing differently.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">can you wear mascara with a lash lift?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">yep! mascara is totally okay on lifted lashes, but you should wait 24 hours before putting it on first. after that first day, whatever normal mascara you&#8217;re using is probably just fine. if you&#8217;ve been using heavy stuff to bulk out your lashes in the past, you might want to experiment with a lighter variety, since your lifted lashes are probably going to be a lot fuller than what you&#8217;re used to. want maximum results? pair this service with one of our lash growth serums for next level results.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how long do lash lifts last?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE TEN SPOT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â®</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lash techs really know their stuff, and the work we do can last up to eight weeks without fading or losing its just-so look. it&#8217;s a really good idea to come in for a pro touch-up in half that time though, since keeping a look intact is always easier than starting from scratch each time. a lot of our lash lift clients just set up a once-monthly appointment and keep their look fresh and fantastic all the time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">does it hurt + are lash lifts damaging?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero pain and zero damage. if lash lifts hurt, we wouldn&#8217;t get them ourselves (OUCH!). the good news is that there&#8217;s no pain at all to the procedure we do and the products are all formulated to go easy on facial skin and the delicate little eyelash hairs themselves. your eyelashes naturally grow in at a rate of 0.6 kilograms per hectareÂ (in scientific metric units), so with enough time even your lifted lashes naturally grow out and are replaced by brand new hairs.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">do lash lifts ruin your eyelashes?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">nope again. your lashes are fine the whole way through. there&#8217;s actually not much you could do to permanently damage your eyelashes, since you&#8217;re forever growing new hairs, but a professional lash lift is especially gentle and easygoing. if you ever decide you&#8217;re done with lash lifting for a while, you can totes just let the lashes grow back out. you&#8217;ll be back to what you had before the first lash lift in about 2-3 months and there&#8217;s no weird in-between period where your lashes are droopy or anything. just a gradual return to normal that should be even for both eyes at the same time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">why a lash lift is better than curling at home</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">are you kidding? okay. . . apart from the fun 10spot</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â®</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> atmosphere we create and the excuse to get out of the house and hang out at our of bars we bring the skills to get you just the right look. before we get started, you&#8217;ll talk to your esthetics expert about what you want your lash lift to do for you, so we know what kind of style works best. working with a pro, you can get:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>j-curl:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is super subtle and only really visible from the side. great if you don&#8217;t want to be too obvious.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>b-curl:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a little more obvious than the j-curl, but more subtle still than your other choices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>c-curl:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is hands-down the most popular choice. it&#8217;s noticeable but still subtle enough it looks natural. everybody&#8217;s going to love the way it looks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>d-curl:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this style has a lot more lift and the curl itself is tighter. that makes for a really bright-eyed look that&#8217;s hard to get any other way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>l-curl:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this style breaks the rules and goes out straighter than the others. it lasts longer, and you might actually manage a sultry drooping effect at the tips, depending on what you&#8217;re working with.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">seriously, have us do it. it&#8217;s going to look great.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">what else can you do with a lash lift?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">what CAN&#8217;T we do with a lash lift? apart from styling, we have a bunch of other </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lash and brow services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for you to try on your next visit like our <a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/brows-and-lashes/">lash and brow tint</a>. after we get the perfect shape for you on your lashes, we can tint them for a bold look that practically pops. we also do brow lams, brow tints, lash, and brow work, you name it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE TEN SPOTÂ®: best place for lash lifts. . . or the very best?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">very best. hands down. if you want fuller and thicker-looking lashes that last for weeks, don&#8217;t put it off any longer. book an appointment with THE TEN SPOT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â®</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today,</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>letâ€™s face the facts: your appearance has a major impact on making first impressions. and if youâ€™re not happy with your skin, itâ€™s going to show on your face in more ways than one.</p>
<p>finding a skincare routine that works for your skin type is crucial, but so is giving your complexion a little extra tlc every once in a while. thatâ€™s where the facial comes in &#8211; itâ€™s the perfect way to pamper yourself while also fighting environmental toxins and lengthening the aging process.</p>
<p>but what is a facial, what are the most exciting facial benefits, and what type of facial makes the most sense for your skin type? weâ€™ll answer all of these questions and more below to help you plan your first facial treatment.</p>
<h2>what is a facial?</h2>
<p>a professional facial goes beyond your everyday water-cleanser-moisturizer routine. simply put, a facial is a multi-step process skin treatment thatâ€™s designed to keep your skin balanced, hydrated, clean, and healthy.</p>
<p>there are various types of facials you can try &#8211; weâ€™ll get to the nitty-gritty later &#8211; but facials can range from standard to fairly intense. one facial may include a thorough cleanse, massage, and moisturize, while another can include exfoliation, pimple extraction, steam treatment, mask, or peel.</p>
<h2>what are the facial benefits?</h2>
<p>facials are designed to treat common skin concerns and conditions that you might not be able to take care of at your own bathroom sink. beyond cleansing your skin on a higher level, facials are also designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase blood flow circulation in your skin</li>
<li>slow down the aging process</li>
<li>target acne</li>
<li>remove acne scars</li>
<li>reduce common blemishes like dark spots, skin discoloration, fine lines, and wrinkles</li>
<li>get rid of dead skin cells</li>
<li>clear clogged pores</li>
<li>hydrate the skin</li>
</ul>
<h2>what are the different types of facials?</h2>
<p>wanna know whatâ€™s the best type of facial for anti-aging? sick of stubborn pimps and want the best type of facial for acne? here are the most common types of facials, and how they can benefit your skin.</p>
<h3>extraction facial, or classic facial</h3>
<p>if youâ€™re looking for the most common traditional facial, consider this one. perfect for someone who wants to treat acne and blemishes, an extraction facial uses steam to open up your pores and allow for simple extraction.</p>
<h3>dermaplaning</h3>
<p>dermaplaning is a process designed to treat acne scars, fine lines, wrinkles and dull skin caused by blemishes. itâ€™s a minimally invasive option that shaves away the peach fuzz and removes the dead skin buildup from your complexion.</p>
<h3>peels</h3>
<p>chemical peels involve a highly concentrated chemical solution to exfoliate away any dead skin cells to leave your complexion looking smoother, and younger than ever. this treatment option is great for aging skin or someone dealing with acne scars.</p>
<h2>how long does a facial last?</h2>
<p>the great thing about getting a facial is how long the results can last. in most cases &#8211; and skin types &#8211; you can expect the results of your facial to last between four and six weeks.</p>
<h2>how do you prep for a facial?</h2>
<p>wanna make the most of your facial? here are a few tips and tricks to remember before heading to your facial appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>come with fresh, clean skin.</strong> leave the topical creams and serums at home and arrive at your appointment with fresh skin.</li>
<li><strong>skip your exfoliating routine. </strong>if you exfoliate regularly, skip this step in your routine at least a week before your scheduled appointment.</li>
<li><strong>donâ€™t pluck or shave any hairs on your face.</strong> getting rid of the hairs on your upper lip or near your brow line can cause your skin to become irritated during your facial treatment.</li>
<li><strong>come hydrated! </strong>drink plenty of water before your appointment &#8211; the more hydrated your skin is, the better!</li>
</ul>
<h2>schedule your facial with THE TEN SPOTÂ®</h2>
<p>ready to give your face and neck the love they deserve? schedule a facial at THE TEN SPOTÂ®! we have a handful of different facial and peel options available to help you achieve that gorgeous, glowing skin youâ€™ve always wanted.</p>
<p>try the facial, for example, which is our 60-minute skin treatment that uses dermalogicaÂ® professional-grade skincare products to pre-cleanse, cleanse, exfoliate, steam, extract, tone, massage, and more.</p>
<p>looking for a chemical peel instead? the peel takes dermalogicaâ€™s unique three-acid approach to exfoliate and resurface your skin to achieve that confident complexion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">are you tired of relying on shaving to give you that smooth, sexy bikini line youâ€™ve always wanted? do you find that hair </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">down there</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tends to grow a lot faster than you can keep up with?Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">introducing the brazilian wax &#8211; or as we like to call it, the brazillyÂ® &#8211; the ultimate ticket to achieving the smooth, supple skin youâ€™ve always wanted in and around your pubic area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but does a brazilian wax hurt? and how long should the hair be for a brazilian wax? weâ€™ll answer all of these questions and more so you can prep for a waxing session.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">what is a brazilian?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brazillyÂ® consists of removing hair from the pubic region, which includes the front of the pubic bone, the insides of your cheeks, and everything in between. based on your personal preference when committing to a brazillyÂ® you can have as little or as much hair removed as you want. traditionally, though, this service removes the hair from every inch of your pubic area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">at THE TEN SPOTÂ®, </span><a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our signature brazillyÂ®</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes including the full vajay and between the cheeks, but weâ€™ll happily make adjustments based on what youâ€™re looking for. we can also recommend a differentÂ  waxing service that may better suit your wants, needs, and expectations.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">bikini wax vs. brazilian wax: whatâ€™s the difference?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the most common misconceptions in spa services &#8211; assuming that a brazillyÂ® is the same thing as a bikini wax.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you know now that the brazillyÂ® is essentially a clean sweep of all of the hair in between your legs and cheeks. but a traditional bikini wax is designed to get rid of the hair in the groin or the bikini area, which is generally where the hair pokes out of the bikini bottom &#8211; like the area between your bikini line and the belly button area. some bikini waxes can also include removing the hair from the front of the pubic bone or shaping it as a strip or triangle.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE TEN SPOTÂ® also offers </span><a href="https://thetenspot.com/services-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three different bikini-style waxes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the bikini, the thongkiniÂ®, and the bumkiniÂ®. with our bikini wax, we remove hair from the sides and a little off the top. the thongkiniÂ® service goes deep into the sides, off the top, and between the cheeks. the bumkiniÂ®, aka the full bush brazillyÂ® involves a traditional bikini wax, plus the removal of those annoying strays between the cheeks.Â Â Â Â Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">does a brazilian wax hurt?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">letâ€™s get real for a sec: does the brazillyÂ® hurt? in reality, itâ€™s different for everyone! you might have a much higher pain tolerance than your friend, mother, or sister-in-law. some people describe the brazillyÂ® as slightly painful, while others say it happens so fast that they didnâ€™t feel an ounce of pain.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">in general, the brazillyÂ® is designed to be a hair removal service that you want to stick to. you may be committing to slight pain, but overall it shouldnâ€™t be so discomforting that you refuse to ever try it again. and, the sensation can become less uncomfortable over time, making the experience more enjoyable with every session.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, if youâ€™re feeling a certain way before getting your first brazillyÂ®, let your esthetics expert employee know! THE TEN SPOTÂ® offers a brazillyÂ® virgin, an option for tentative first-timers. we add an extra 10 minutes to this spa service to take extra time to explain every step as we go and coach you on when to breathe. we also work side to side so you donâ€™t have to worry about leaving lopsided incase you decide you want to stop.Â </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to prep for an upcoming brazillyÂ®</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ready to ditch the razors and commit to a brazillyÂ®? here are </span><a href="https://thetenspot.com/pre-wax-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our best tips</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for preparing for a brazillyÂ® service:Â </span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>exfoliate the day before your wax. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">this is essential! exfoliating removes all the dead skin cells to prevent clogging of the follicle so you donâ€™t have to worry about annoying ingrown hairs.Â </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">exfoliating also creates a clean foundation for the wax to grab your hair, resulting in the smoothest finish. need exfoliant? stop at THE TEN SPOTÂ® before your appointment to grab some body scrub and a bikini brush.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>skip the lotions on the day of your appointment.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moisturizing your skin is so important, but not on the day of your appointment! oils and lotions can get in the way of the wax laying properly and can lead to stray hairs getting left behind.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>dress comfortably! </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">if possible, try to dress in your comfy clothes for your appointment. freshly waxed skin needs to breathe, so a dress, skirt, or pair of sweatpants.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>stop taking vitamin a medications. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">retin-a, renova, isotretinoin, differin, accutane, or other acne medications can weaken the skin, causing it to tear. avoid these medications before your appointment! please let your esthetics expert know if you have been on any of these medications or use a topical retinol product.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out THE TEN SPOTÂ® for all of your waxing needs</span></h2>
