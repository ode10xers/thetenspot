As we mentioned above, how fast depends on your natural hair color and type. but your beauty tech can give you all the deets about how often you&#8217;ll need to have it reapplied. as long as you don&#8217;t have any reactions to the tint (which are super rare), you should be perfectly fine to get a reapplication every 4 to 6 weeks or so.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does tinting damage your eyebrows?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as long as you get your tint done at a reputable place like THE TEN SPOT\u00ae, you shouldn&#8217;t see any damage to your brows. we already discussed the possibility of allergic reactions, so we know you get it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but there is one other thing to be wary of. doing your brow tint at home or going to a sketchy place could mean that harsh chemicals are used. that&#8217;s a big no-no because the skin on your face is so sensitive. good news, we know this and don&#8217;t use any of those harsh chemicals in our brow tint, brow lam or any other treatment we perform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microblading vs. tinting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microblading and tinting are two options if you want your brows to look fuller and darker. but what&#8217;s the real difference?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">microblading is a process that adds pigment to your skin using a tattoo method. the results are semipermanent and will last between 6 months and 2 years, depending on various factors. this service takes about 2 hours to complete. the good news is that the results last longer because the skin is dyed instead of the hair. but this good news can also be bad news. if you don&#8217;t like the final results of your microblading, there&#8217;s nothing you can do to change it, and you&#8217;re stuck with it for up to 2 years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and there are additional risks associated with microblading. your skin is likely to get red and puffy because it&#8217;s being tattooed. it&#8217;s also possible for the area to become infected, and the risk of allergic reaction still exists.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tinting is a less permanent and safer way to have your brows on point. plus, on the off chance you don&#8217;t like the way your brows look, you just don&#8217;t get a reapplication when the time comes. easy peasy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">book a brow tint from THE TEN SPOT\u00ae today<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">thinking a brow tint will have you feeling like a perfect 10?<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/go.booker.com\/brand\/thetenspotusbrand\/locations?_gl=1*hfh0if*_gcl_au*ODIxNzYwMTMwLjE2OTA1NDA2ODU.*_ga*MTc0NDcyNzQ3LjE2OTA1NDA2ODY.*_ga_Q6Y979B0TM*MTY5MDc5ODk3NC41LjEuMTY5MDc5OTA4Ny42MC4wLjA.&_ga=2.204935760.1174732286.1690669144-174472747.1690540686\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">book your brow services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with THE TEN SPOT\u00ae today!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we offer many other services, so you can make a whole day of it. combine your brow tint with lash services and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/nails\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fresh nails<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. you deserve it!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>if keeping your brows on point has become a little time-consuming, a brow tint could be what you&#8217;re looking for. a tint can [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":25,"featured_media":27750,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[98,97],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-27744","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-kristen-blog","category-tips"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>how long does a brow tint last? - THE TEN SPOT\u00ae<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"learn all about brow tinting including: the pros and cons of eyebrow tinting, and how long brow tints last.
