extension types + how to choose"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>getting your nails done can be a relaxing experience that makes you feel fantastic. the thing is, there are so many options to choose from, with various types of extensions on offer at different salons. if you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed trying to figure out <a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/nails\/\">the best types of nail extensions for you,<\/a> you&#8217;re not alone.<\/p>\n<p>don&#8217;t worry, because we got you! below, we&#8217;ve created a listing of some of the most common types of nail extensions so you understand what&#8217;s available and the benefits or downsides of each type. we&#8217;ve also answered some of your most burning questions\u00a0to help you figure out how to choose a type.<\/p>\n<h2>types of nail extensions<\/h2>\n<p>some of the most common types of nail extensions include acrylics, hard gel, acrygel, apr\u00e9s, and bio gel. let&#8217;s dive into some pros and cons of these standard nail extension types.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acrylics<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>because packs of these are commonly sold in stores for you to place on at\u00a0home, these are likely the\u00a0nail extensions most people instinctively think of. while it&#8217;s true these nails are relatively easy to put on and can be extra long, they&#8217;ve got some serious downsides. for starters, acrylics have a strong smell, and they&#8217;re known to cause allergic reactions in some people &#8230; and an allergic reaction can be a real mood killer when you just want to feel fabulous. oh, acrylics also damage your natural nail because of the chemicals used.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hard gel<\/h3>\n<p>hard gel is a big step up from acrylics because they don&#8217;t smell awful and are more flexible, meaning less chance of breakage. you can also ustimze your length, short or long. it can be done with extensions or forms.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acrygel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>acrygel is a hybrid extension crafted from acrylics and hard gel. it&#8217;s hypoallergenic, as well as light and flexible. but acrygel extensions can&#8217;t be soaked off and are generally hard to remove. plus, your options are minimal because not many brands make these. those that do only have a select few colors, shapes or lengths available. if you&#8217;re looking for a specific color or design, these may not be the right choice for you.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apr\u00e9s x\/designEx<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 4;\">with apr\u00e9s x\/designEx, you&#8217;ll only find premade shapes and lengths, so customizations in size and shape are a no-go. apr\u00e9s extensions are easy to remove since they are soak off removal making them\u00a0 a healthy option for your natural nails.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">faqs<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>you got questions about nail extensions? we got answers. below are answers to some of the most common questions about nail extensions to help you choose the best option.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which type of nail extension is best?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>gel nail extensions are generally much better than acrylic nail extensions. we think our design xnail extensions are top-notch, thanks to how healthy they are for your nails. plus, they look amazing, too.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what are the healthiest nail extensions?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>our revolutionary product, the extensions, is one of the healthiest types of nail extensions. designEx nail extensions are created using a special gel that can be clear or pigmented. but instead of the color being layered on top, it&#8217;s worked into the polish for a chip-free style. what&#8217;s more, at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae, all our extensions are nontoxic, vegan and cruelty-free.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which is better, nail extensions or acrylics?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>it depends on what you&#8217;re looking to accomplish. nail extensions are generally better because they&#8217;re healthier and more natural. but acrylics are the best choice if\u00a0you&#8217;re looking for super long nails, which can&#8217;t be achieved with extensions.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what are the least damaging fake nails?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>designEx nail extensions are a win again. gel nails are less likely to cause damage to your natural nail or gel bed than acrylics. they also feel more natural, so you can feel like a perfect ten without your nails feeling awkward. oh, and gel nails are more flexible, too, so if you hit them against something, they&#8217;re less likely to snap. anyone who&#8217;s had fake nails before knows the pain of one of those babies hitting something and snapping off, possibly taking part of your nail or bed (or skin) with it. yikes.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which is more damaging, acrylic vs. gel nails?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>acrylic nails are definitely more damaging, hands down. acrylics can cause damage to your gorgeous natural nails, which can ultimately cause pain or even create an infection in your nail. nobody wants that when they&#8217;re just trying to live their life as a ten.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">book nail
