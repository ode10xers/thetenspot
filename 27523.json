If you&#8217;ve got sweat and dead skin and ingrown hairs going on down there, they&#8217;re going to fight against the wax. we know you&#8217;re keeping everything clean and sassy already, but if you come in just post-shower, you&#8217;ll feel better (and so will your esthetician). coming on your way home from work? don\u2019t worry we have our famous wipette\u00ae available in bar for a last minute tidy up.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>step 4: stay loose<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>you may want to show off the spectacular results of your brazilly right away by slipping into your favorite thong&#8230; but hold off on that for a sec. you are not going to wear tight jeans (or tight anything) right away after a brazilian. it&#8217;s time for those soft cotton panties and a pair of loose parachute pants or sweats. no lace (too itchy). just softness, comfort and a chance to let everything breathe for a day or so.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>step 5: take a pain reliever<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>did you know you can take an over-the-counter pain reliever before you feel any pain? pop an ibuprofen (or another fave over-the-counter painkiller of choice) about 30 minutes before your appointment for the greatest effect. if you want to apply a numbing cream(we sell zensa (the best one) in bar!), that can help a lot, too, as it deadens the nerve cells in the skin that&#8217;s about to hit the hot wax. but don&#8217;t (do. not.) try to numb it with alcohol. it&#8217;ll make things hurt even more. you can have a mimosa or margarita after you&#8217;re done to celebrate.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>step 6: breathe<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>deep breathing can make a real difference during your brazilly. don&#8217;t hold your breath. instead, ask your esthetics expert to guide you on some deep breathing techniques so you exhale at just the right time.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>step 7: relax<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>yeah, easy for us to say, right? but seriously \u2014 the more you&#8217;re able to relax, the better your brazilian will go. maybe that means a little yoga ahead of time or some stretching exercises. after all, your esthetics expert is going to ask you to move into some unusual positions so they can reach all the nooks and crannies. maybe you&#8217;ll want to bring a stress ball to squeeze, or maybe you&#8217;re the earbud type who wants to listen to soothing music or sounds. don\u2019t forget our treatment rooms, have tvs! feel free to watch your fave show on netflix. no matter what, the more you relax, the better you&#8217;ll feel \u2014 and just remember that you can trust your esthetics expert , who is an expert and will be as efficient and pain-free as humanly possible.<\/p>\n<p>now that you know how to prepare for your brazilian wax, you may have a few questions. let&#8217;s answer them<\/p>\n<h2><strong>faqs<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>can you get a brazilian wax while pregnant?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>it&#8217;s perfectly safe to get a brazilly while you&#8217;re pregnant, though do be aware that your skin may be more sensitive at this time. hold off, though, as you approach your due date, especially if you have a c-section planned. (and if even if you don&#8217;t have one planned, as you never know what might happen.) you don&#8217;t want ultra sensitive skin during surgery, and waxing can slightly increase the risk of infection.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>does a brazilian wax hurt?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>for most people, yes. (hey, we will always be honest with you. always.). at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae, we take every step to make your brazilly\u00ae as pleasant as comfortable \u2014 and we know you will be happy with the results. if you&#8217;re a first-timer, follow the steps above to make it all less painful, and prepare yourself mentally (including for the lack of privacy).<\/p>\n<h3><strong>what should you not do before a brazilian wax?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>don&#8217;t shave. don&#8217;t drink alcohol. and don&#8217;t schedule yourself too tightly (including any activities that may show off your new gorgeous smoothness), since you&#8217;ll want a little recovery time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>should you trim your pubic hair before a brazilian wax?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>you can if you want, but there&#8217;s no need to. our esthetics expert will handle any trimming at the start of the procedure.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>what are your brazilian wax options?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae, we offer you all sorts of cool <a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/services-waxing\/\">brazilian wax options<\/a>. our signature brazilly\u00ae takes off everything (or as much as you want), including between the cheeks \u2014 and we have a special customized first-timer version for your brazilian virgins. our thongkini\u00ae goes deep into the sides and top as well as between the cheeks, and our bumkini\u00ae is essentially a bikini wax with special between-the-cheek attention. of course you can get a classic bikini wax as well. call us today to book an appointment for your fave.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>smooth and gorgeous. that&#8217;s what you want from a brazilian wax and that&#8217;s what you get at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae. whether you&#8217;re a [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":27524,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[98,97],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-27523","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-kristen-blog","category-tips"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO Premium plugin v23.1 (Yoast SEO v23.1) - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>how to prepare for a brazilian wax | THE TEN SPOT<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"learn all you need to know about preparing for a brazilian wax.
