you totally can! the magic word is lash lift. what are lash lifts, you ask? check it out:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what are lash lifts?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lash lifts are a professional eyelash lifting procedure that leaves your lashes looking full and lifted for weeks without having to do anything to them at home. when you get a lash lift, you&#8217;re changing the shape and augmenting your natural lashes to curl up and look thicker and fuller.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how does it work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it takes about 40 minutes to do most people&#8217;s lashes. we start by cleaning your lashes with a gentle solution to cleanse prepare their surfaces all over. then we lay a protective silicone shield over your eyelid to keep the adhesive off your skin as well as secure your lower lashes down and away from the upper lashes we will be working with. adhesive is applied to the shield, we curl the lashes evenly up over the shield to get the shape they need. finally,\u00a0 we apply las solution for 8 minutes, followed by a neutralizing solution for 5 minutes. you&#8217;re all good right after the job is done!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to take care of your new lashes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after your new lashes are finished, it&#8217;s a good idea to keep makeup and water off of them for about 24 hours. that lets the product we use to fix the lashes fully set (<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">water touching the hair will open the hair cuticles and alter the bonds)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. after that, you&#8217;re good to go. just do your normal makeup routine, treat your new, full-bodied lashes like you would any other amazingly beautiful part of your face. all that\u2019s left to do is enjoy compliments from friends who can&#8217;t quite place what&#8217;s changed about your look, but who like whatever it is you&#8217;re doing differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can you wear mascara with a lash lift?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">yep! mascara is totally okay on lifted lashes, but you should wait 24 hours before putting it on first. after that first day, whatever normal mascara you&#8217;re using is probably just fine. if you&#8217;ve been using heavy stuff to bulk out your lashes in the past, you might want to experiment with a lighter variety, since your lifted lashes are probably going to be a lot fuller than what you&#8217;re used to. want maximum results? pair this service with one of our lash growth serums for next level results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how long do lash lifts last?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THE TEN SPOT<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00ae<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lash techs really know their stuff, and the work we do can last up to eight weeks without fading or losing its just-so look. it&#8217;s a really good idea to come in for a pro touch-up in half that time though, since keeping a look intact is always easier than starting from scratch each time. a lot of our lash lift clients just set up a once-monthly appointment and keep their look fresh and fantastic all the time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">does it hurt + are lash lifts damaging?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zero pain and zero damage. if lash lifts hurt, we wouldn&#8217;t get them ourselves (OUCH!). the good news is that there&#8217;s no pain at all to the procedure we do and the products are all formulated to go easy on facial skin and the delicate little eyelash hairs themselves. your eyelashes naturally grow in at a rate of 0.6 kilograms per hectare\u00a0(in scientific metric units), so with enough time even your lifted lashes naturally grow out and are replaced by brand new hairs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do lash lifts ruin your eyelashes?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nope again. your lashes are fine the whole way through. there&#8217;s actually not much you could do to permanently damage your eyelashes, since you&#8217;re forever growing new hairs, but a professional lash lift is especially gentle and easygoing. if you ever decide you&#8217;re done with lash lifting for a while, you can totes just let the lashes grow back out. you&#8217;ll be back to what you had before the first lash lift in about 2-3 months and there&#8217;s no weird in-between period where your lashes are droopy or anything. just a gradual return to normal that should be even for both eyes at the same time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why a lash lift is better than curling at home<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are you kidding?
