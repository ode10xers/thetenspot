benefits of laser hair removal"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">although there\u2019s no such thing as bad body hair, everyone has preferences about where they do or don\u2019t want their hair. as an alternative to shaving, <a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/services-waxing\/\">waxing hair removal services<\/a> and other treatments, the benefits of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/laser-hair-removal\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">laser hair removal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> make it one of the most effective ways to get rid of unwanted hair.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">laser hair removal is a short and sweet procedure that destroys hair follicles for permanent hair removal or reduction. if you\u2019re thinking about enjoying benefits such as soft and silky skin, convenient treatments and cost savings, learn more about laser hair removal and its benefits below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how does laser hair removal work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when performed at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae beauty bar, laser hair removal is a\u00a0surprisingly simple process. a tech applies pulses of laser to your hair and follicles, basically vaporizing it from the root and preventing it from growing back.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it typically takes several sessions to eliminate most unwanted hair, but the number of sessions you\u2019ll actually need depends largely on your hair and skin pigmentation, hair coarseness, growth cycles, hormonal influences and the area of your body. it is most effective for people with high contrast between their skin and hair, but modern lasers can address any unwanted hair. results vary, but some lucky people claim they\u2019ve enjoyed 10 or more years of hairlessness.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is laser hair removal healthy?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">although vaporizing your hair with a laser sounds intense, it\u2019s totally safe when performed at THE TEN SPOT\u00ae.\u00a0 some redness and swelling after treatment is normal, and you should avoid and protect the lasered area from the sun. if you\u2019re pregnant, taking certain medications or have sensitive skin issues, laser hair removal may not be the right option for you talk to your ee for the best recommendation for your and your skin needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electrolysis vs laser hair removal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">electrolysis is the next most permanent hair removal option after lasering. both provide great long-term results, but electrolysis works differently by inserting an epilator into each hair follicle to stop new hair growth. since each hair needs to be individually zapped, sessions can take a long time and be pretty uncomfortable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9 benefits of laser hair removal\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">when you\u2019ve had it with the annoyances of shaving, waxing and plucking, laser hair removal is your new bestie. check out some laser hair removal benefits below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">quick and convenient<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lasers are fast and efficient at their job, and they can treat many hairs with just one pulse. small areas, such as the upper lip, can be done in a few minutes. if you\u2019re opting for a brazilly or bumkini session, expect to spend about 25 minutes. most areas don\u2019t take longer than 30 minutes or so, which means you can easily slot your session in without compromising on your free time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less painful<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">calling laser hair removal pleasant would be a stretch, but it\u2019s definitely less painful than waxing or electrolysis. depending on the area, you might feel a pinching sensation throughout the session. it also has zero downtime \u2014 aside from potential slight redness, swelling or tenderness, there\u2019s few to no side effects so you can get right back to your day post-treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">precise hair removal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if you thought you were precise with a razor, think again. whether trimming your bikini line or regularly shaving in the shower, getting those random hairs that grow in weird places, laser hair removal can target tiny and specific areas without causing damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lasers can go anywhere<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">okay, lasers can go <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">almost<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> anywhere. your lashes are too close to your eyes to safely laser them off, but lasers can zap hairs anywhere from up your nose to between your cheeks. that means no more shaving in sensitive areas or contorting in the shower to shave hard-to-reach hair.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">say goodbye to ingrown hairs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most people who have tried shaving, waxing and other hair removal methods know the pain and annoyance of ingrown\u00a0hairs. if you\u2019re especially prone to ingrown hairs, laser hair removal can prevent your hair from growing back. if a lasered follicle does eventually produce hair, it\u2019ll be finer and less likely to curl and become ingrown.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consistent soft + silky results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unlike shaving, laser hair removal won\u2019t leave behind stray hairs or stubble and consistently has soft and silky results. even between treatments when some hairs grow back, they should be much thinner and softer than they were pre-zapping. it may even reduce acne or other skin issues caused by unruly hair follicles, improving your skin\u2019s texture over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no more awkward regrowth<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">waxing and plucking require you to endure that awkward regrowth phase before hair is long enough to treat again. with laser hair removal, you\u2019ll actually need to shave before each session so the laser\u2019s energy can focus on the hair root.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">save money!<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">although the upfront cost of laser hair removal can be off putting, it\u2019s actually much easier on your wallet than other hair removal options. between shaving creams, razors and waxing appointments, hair removal costs can add up over time. when you zap these costs with laser hair removal, you\u2019ll see savings in the long term.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">long term + permanent<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the main benefits of laser hair removal is its long-term potency and permanence. in most cases, hair is unlikely to grow back after the follicle is destroyed. at the minimum, you\u2019ll see a permanent reduction in hair growth and increased fineness that makes maintenance easier. you may need a touch up occasionally, but results should last for years after treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>although there\u2019s no such thing as bad body hair, everyone has preferences about where they do or don\u2019t want their
