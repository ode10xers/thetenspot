If you&#8217;re curious about the different types of manicures available, read on for a handy primer.<\/p>\n<h2>what are shellac nails?<\/h2>\n<p>shellac is a patented brand that&#8217;s made by one specific company. gel polish is mixed with traditional nail polish to make a nail that hardens under UV light and has a shiny finish. gel polish is popular because it&#8217;s quick and easy to use, with consistently good results.<\/p>\n<h3>is gel polish bad for your nails?<\/h3>\n<p>when you use UV light to cure the shellac, it adheres to the nail. because of this, it&#8217;s really important to take the time to have your extensions removed properly. if you just chip away at them, or try to yank them off because the removal process is taking too long, you could easily damage your nails.<\/p>\n<h3>how long do gel overlay\u2019s nails last?<\/h3>\n<p>gel overlays nails can typically last for about two weeks, although if you take good care of them the finish could last three weeks or longer. the main issue is that your nails are growing underneath the overlay, and eventually that growth will start to show. at that point, you&#8217;ll need to have the extension or overlay filled if you&#8217;ve got gel overlay or extensions. nails, take a tip from us. get them properly removed. your nails will thank you.<\/p>\n<h2>what is gel nail polish?<\/h2>\n<p>gel nail polish use

(and who isn&#8217;t?!), gel is the way to go. our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thetenspot.com\/services-2\/nails\/\">mani and pedi<\/a> service offers gel nails, because we&#8217;re big fans of their durability and versatility.<\/p>\n<h3>acrylic vs gel overlay vs gel polish<\/h3>\n<p>acrylic nails have lost out in popularity compared to gel overlaly and gel nail polish lately, but they do have some use cases. extensions are very strong, and they&#8217;re suited to creating ong nails. so, if you&#8217;ve been accustomed to having short nails and want to turn heads with some nice long nails, extensions could be the best option.<\/p>\n<p>gel polish is lightweight and offers a natural-looking, shiny finish. it is hard-wearing and it does look good, so if you&#8217;re looking for smart nails for a big celebration, gel polish could get the job done.<\/p>\n<p>gel overlay nails are strong and hard-wearing, but they&#8217;re a bit heavier than shellac. you have control over the shape of the
